Preface

This AP CS A Java 2019 course was adapted from the AP CS A Java Review e-book written by Dr. Barbara Ericson, while she was a senior research scientist at Georgia Tech, currently Assistant Professor of Information at University of Michigan. She published this book using a modified BSD license to encourage people to use it, change it, and modify it for their own purposes. 

The 2019 version of this book is being modified by Dr. Beryl Hoffman, Associate Professor of Computer Science at Elms College, MA, with the support of a 2019 Google CS-ER grant and the Mobile CSP project (https://www.mobile-csp.org).  Special thanks to Barb Ericson, Beth Simon, John Figliulo, Pauline Lake, Jennifer Rosato, Kim Evelti, Becky Stacey, Art Lopez, and Kyle Gillette for feedback, edits, and ideas. We hope that CSP teachers and students can use this interactive book to help transition from AP CSP to AP CS A.

We gratefully acknowledge the use of the Runestone platform and Jobe server run by Brad Miller, and the past use of the Jobe server from the University of Canterbury, New Zealand. 

Special thanks also to the following people that we have collaborated with:

* Jeff (Jochen) Rick made great contributions to the Parsons problems (mixed up code problems).

* Philip Guo who created the Java Visualizer, which we link to.  We would love to embed it in this ebook, but need someone to do that.

* Paul Resnick at the University of Michigan for hosting us all at the summer 2016 hackathon for Runestone Interactive and for his input into the design of the instructor dashboard.

* Brad Miller and David Ranum and the students at Luther College, who created the Runestone Interactive platform.  Brad Miller has been keeping it going for years.

Thank you also to the National Science Foundation for supporting our ebook work through several grants: Grant No. 1432300, 1138378, and 1228352.
