Mixed Up Code Practice
------------------------------

Try to solve each of the following. Click the *Check Me* button to check each solution.  You will be told if your solution is too short, has a block in the wrong order, or you are using the wrong block.  Some of the problems may have an extra block that isn't needed in the correct solution.  Try to solve these on your phone or other mobile device!

           Line 5 is missing a semicolon.  Line 6 has ``Double`` instead of ``double``.  Remember that the primitive types all start with a lowercase letter.  Line 8 has ``tripmiles`` instead of ``tripMiles``.  Remember that you should uppercase the first letter of each new word to make the variable name easier to read (use camel case).

           Calculate how many weeks it would take to make $200.  Next divide the number of weeks by 4 (roughly the number of weeks in a month).

              Write the code to calculate the number of miles you can drive if you have a 10 gallon gas tank and are down to a quarter of a tank of gas and your car gets 32 miles per gallon.

        .. tab:: Answer
        
           First calculate the number of gallons you have left and then multiply that by the miles per gallon to get the number of miles you can still drive.

              Write the code to print the number of chicken wings you can buy if you have $4.50 and they cost $0.75 each.  Remember that you can't buy part of a wing.

        .. tab:: Answer
        
           Divide the amount of money you have by the cost of each wing and set the result to an integer since you can't buy a part of a wing.
