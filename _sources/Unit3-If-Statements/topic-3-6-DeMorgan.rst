Equivalent Boolean Expressions (DeMorgan's Laws)
================================================

..	index::
	single: DeMorgan's Laws
	single: negation
	
DeMorgan's Laws were developed by Augustus De Morgan in the 1800s.  They show how to simplify the negation of a complex boolean expression, which is when there are multiple expressions joined by an AND (&&) or OR (||), such as ``(x < 3) && (y > 2)``. When you negate one of these complex expressions, you can simplify it by flipping the operators and end up with an equivalent expression. De Morgan's Laws state the following equivalencies. Here's an easy way to remember De Morgan's Laws: **move the NOT inside, AND becomes OR** and **move the NOT inside, OR becomes AND**.

    Figure 1: De Morgan's Laws to simplify complex expressions


In Java, De Morgan's Laws are written with the following operators:

    -  **!(a && b)** is equivalent to **!a || !b**
    
    -  **!(a || b)** is equivalent to **!a && !b** 
    
You can also simplify negated boolean expressions that have relational operators like <, >, ==. You can  remove negation by moving it inside and flipping the relational operator to its opposite sign. For example, not (c equals d) is the same as saying c does not equal d.  An easy way to remember this is **Move the NOT inside, flip the sign** (== becomes !=, < becomes >=, and > becomes <=).


  - !(c == d) is equivalent to (c != d)
  - !(c != d) is equivalent to (c == d)
  - !(c < d) is equivalent to (c >= d)
  - !(c > d) is equivalent to (c <= d)
  - !(c <= d) is equivalent to (c > d)
  - !(c >= d) is equivalent to (c < d)

Although you do not have to memorize DeMorgan's Laws for the CS A Exam, you should be able to show that two boolean expressions are equivalent. One way to do this is by using truth tables. For example, we can show that !(a && b) == !a || !b by constructing the truth table below and seeing that they give identical results for the 2 expressions (the last 2 columns in the table below are identical!).

+-------+-------+-----------+----------+
| a     | b     | !(a && b) | !a || !b |
+=======+=======+===========+==========+
| true  | true  | false     | false    |
+-------+-------+-----------+----------+
| false | true  | true      | true     |
+-------+-------+-----------+----------+
| true  | false | true      | true     |
+-------+-------+-----------+----------+
| false | false | true      | true     |
+-------+-------+-----------+----------+

Often, you can simplify boolean expressions to create equivalent expressions. For example, applying DeMorgan's Laws to ``!(x < 3 && y > 2)`` yields ``!(x < 3) || !(y > 2)`` as seen in the figure below. This can then be simplified further by moving the not operator inside and flipping the relation operators. So, ``!(x < 3) || !(y > 2)`` is simplified to ``(x >= 3 || y <= 2)`` where the relational operators are flipped and the negation is removed. These two simplification steps are seen below.

We encourage you to do this activity as a |POGIL| (Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning) group activity. POGIL groups are self-managed teams of up to 4 students where everyone has a |pogil role| and works together to solve the problems, making sure that everyone in the team participates and learns. 

Explore the following problems with your group. You may use |this worksheet| to complete your truth tables. Assume that x is an integer value, for example -1, 0, or 1. 

1. Complete a truth table for the boolean expression: !(x == 0 || x >= 1). Is this the set of positive or negative numbers?  Is the expression true when x is positive? Or is it true when x is negative? You can try out the values when x is 1 or -1 or 0. Note that 0 is not positive or negative. You can try running the code below to check your answer.


2. Complete a truth table for the boolean expression: !(x == 0) && !(x >= 1). Is this the set of positive or negative numbers?

3. Complete a truth table for the boolean expression: (x != 0) && (x < 1). Is this the set of positive or negative numbers?

4. Are the 3 boolean expressions equivalent? Why or why not?

5. Test your answers using the active code window below.

Summary
--------

- De Morgan’s Laws can be applied to Boolean expressions to create equivalent ones:

  - !(a && b) is equivalent to !a || !b 
  - !(a || b) is equivalent to !a && !b 

- A negated expression with a relational operator can be simplified by flipping the relational operator and removing the not. 

  - !(c == d) is equivalent to (c != d)
  - !(c != d) is equivalent to (c == d)
  - !(c < d) is equivalent to (c >= d)
  - !(c > d) is equivalent to (c <= d)
  - !(c <= d) is equivalent to (c > d)
  - !(c >= d) is equivalent to (c < d)
  
- Truth tables can be used to prove that 2 Boolean expressions are identical.

- Equivalent Boolean expressions will evaluate to the same value in all cases.
